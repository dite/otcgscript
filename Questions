Some questions to consider, and ask at some point:

1) Should there be anti-spam checks for forms, or should most just need login?
 - If there are spam checks, they will be editable in the settings, rather than being on every form page. Certain spam words
 tend to cause problems for certain TCGs, so it'd have to be easily editable.
   - EX: Nidalee (League of Legends) is called the "Bestial Huntress", but 'bestial" is
        considered spam. It also doesn't consider spaces, so anything Koda Kumi has problems with "kum".
