Subject Creators (ex: Square Enix for Final Fantasy)*
Commonly-used Sites**


*In a multi-subject TCG, such as "Gaming" or "Manga", you probably don't have to list every creator, although if you can, it
would be a positive.
** Mainly if you use a couple of websites a lot (such as getting a lot of your information or images). Always credit fanart
artists, and list the cards that feature their work.
