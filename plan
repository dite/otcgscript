These are the initial plans for the script:

CORE SCRIPT----------
 - Affiiliates
 - Link Buttons
 - Decks / Upcoming Decks
  - Decks: includes table fields for "Category, Deck Name, File Name, Desc1, Desc2, Set" ***
  - Upcoming Decks: includes table fields for "Category, Deck Name, File Name, Desc1, Desc2, Set, Votes, Made"
  - Worth and count would be decided by the Category.
 - Member pages
 - Credits page
  - You'd be able to add other credits, but it will give the basic credits you should need (ex: Calico), as well as
  as well as suggestions and reminders on who should be credited.
DECK FIELDS NOTE: The Desc1, Desc2, and Set will be optional, required or even hidden, depending on what Cards page you have.
                  Also, Desc1 and Desc2 will just be the table names. You will be able to define them in your Settings.
DECK FIELDS EX: An example of how it could be useful to use ALL fields.

Overdrive's Yuna Deck (http://carbonbeauty.net/overdrive/viewcards.php?deck=summoner)
 Category: Character
 Deck Name: Summoner
 File Name: summoner
 Desc1 (as Subject): Yuna
 Desc2 (as Description): Yuna is a young summoner who defeats Sin.
 Set: Final Fantasy
 
UPCOMING DECKS NOTE: Most things would be optional (such as File Name and Deck Name). Made would be a "Y" or "N" option
                     to say whether or not the deck has been created. As an if statement, could be used to divide "Upcoming"
                     and "Unreleased" decks.
 
OPTIONAL SCRIPTS-----
 - About pages
  - There will not be an About page included in the core script, as it should usually be different for each TCG. But, there
    will be optional pages. There will be a basic About page that uses information you input for a generic information page,
    as well as a Section-By-Section option that gives you sections that you can edit yourself. It'll be your words and info.
    The SBS version will just make sure you got everything members would need.
 - Different Card Management pages.
  - The core script will include a basic cards page without fields for "Desc2, Sets".
  - There will be a 
 - Deck Voting Script
  - While the "votes" field will be in the core, the actual script will be optional, and an include a "Reset Votes" option
    for those who don't want votes to carry over.
